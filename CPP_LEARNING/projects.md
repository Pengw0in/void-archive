   - **Learning Goal**: Understand arrays, loops, and basic sorting algorithms.
   - **Challenge**: Implement a second sorting algorithm and compare performance.

### 2. **Array Rotation**
   - **Description**: Write a program that rotates an array by a certain number of positions.
   - **Learning Goal**: Practice array manipulation and indexing.
   - **Challenge**: Implement an optimized version without using extra space.

### 3. **Find Maximum and Minimum in an Array**
   - **Description**: Create a program that finds the maximum and minimum values in an array.
   - **Learning Goal**: Practice array traversal and comparison.
   - **Challenge**: Optimize for time and space efficiency.

### 4. **2D Matrix Manipulation**
   - **Description**: Create a program to perform basic operations on a 2D matrix (e.g., addition, multiplication, transposition).
   - **Learning Goal**: Learn how to use multi-dimensional arrays and loops.
   - **Challenge**: Implement matrix inversion or determinant calculation.

### 5. **Vector-Based Stack Implementation**
   - **Description**: Implement a stack data structure using a C++ vector (with push, pop, and top operations).
   - **Learning Goal**: Learn how to work with C++ vectors and implement a basic data structure.
   - **Challenge**: Implement a function to check if parentheses in a mathematical expression are balanced.

### 6. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

   - **Learning Goal**: Practice 2D arrays and condition checking.
   - **Challenge**: Add features like an AI opponent or different board sizes.

### 7. **Unique Elements in an Array**
   - **Description**: Create a program that finds unique elements in an array (i.e., elements that appear only once).
   - **Learning Goal**: Practice traversing arrays and using hash maps or simple algorithms to count occurrences.
   - **Challenge**: Optimize the solution to work in linear time.

### 8. **Reverse an Array**
   - **Description**: Write a program to reverse the elements of an array in-place.
   - **Learning Goal**: Understand array indexing and manipulation.
   - **Challenge**: Reverse the array using recursion instead of loops.

### 9. **Linear Search and Binary Search**
   - **Description**: Implement both linear search and binary search algorithms for finding an element in an array.
   - **Learning Goal**: Understand searching algorithms and array indexing.
   - **Challenge**: Compare performance of both search algorithms.

### 10. **Sum of Array Elements**
   - **Description**: Create a program that calculates the sum of elements in an array or vector.
   - **Learning Goal**: Learn array traversal and basic arithmetic.
   - **Challenge**: Use recursion instead of loops.
