# Quartet

Hello everyone!

In this writeup, let's see how we can solve the Quartet CTF challenge from NahamCon 2025.

We are given four files with strange extensions. Well, they may seem strange for someone who's seeing them for the first time, but they're not!

These files with "zX" (where X is a number) extensions are parts of a single zip file (.zip). Basically, combining these zip files will give us one single complete zip file in theory.

Let's try to combine them with the following command:

```bash
cat * > main.zip # Make sure all these files are in an isolated folder!
```

Now let's unzip this main.zip file:

```bash
unzip main.zip
```

And alas! We are greeted with an error, which is just a warning ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

```bash
Archive:  main.zip
warning [main.zip]:  zipfile claims to be last disk of a multi-part archive;
  attempting to process anyway, assuming all parts have been concatenated
  together in order.  Expect "errors" and warnings...true multi-part support
  doesn't exist yet (coming soon).
warning [main.zip]:  1526784 extra bytes at beginning or within zipfile
  (attempting to process anyway)
file #1:  bad zipfile offset (local header sig):  1526788
  (attempting to re-compensate)
  inflating: quartet.jpeg
```

Meh, just ignore them. We can see `inflating: quartet.jpeg` at the end, which means a JPEG file is extracted from main.zip. Let's look at it.

Woah, a quartet! No wonder the CTF name is the same. Well, it's an image. Let's search for strings and filter them out with the following command:

```bash
strings quartet.jpeg | grep "flag"
```

And there you go‚Äîthe flag will appear!
