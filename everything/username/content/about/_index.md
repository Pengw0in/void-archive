### Low-quality polymath  
Sophomore-year computer science student.  
Not really sure what I'm doing, but I'm doing *something*.

## What I Actually Do  
- Sometimes solve CTFs (and sometimes just stare at them)  
- Sometimes learn assembly or C/C++ just to suffer
- Sometimes design stuff (figma mostly) 
- Sometimes catch pokÃ©mons for... shinies. (im tired)

## Current Status  
- Grinding on TryHackMe
- Probably farming for an Admant [Axew](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/axew)

## Motto  
> *Somewhere, a duck is watching.*
